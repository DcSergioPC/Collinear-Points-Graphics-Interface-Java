# Collinear-Points-Graphics-Interface-Java
This is an implementacion of at least 4 collinear points that use a graphics interface to show these points
and have some animation to see how generate each of the segments, to accelerate/decelerate the animation, only press the
"-" or "+" keys and this implementacion have many inputs.

the fast algorith of find 3 or more points collinear have o complexity of O((n^2)log(n))
